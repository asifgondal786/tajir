# Project Description: Forex Companion

## Vision
Forex Companion is designed as a unified AI trading copilot that can monitor forex markets, reason about market conditions, execute with strict safety controls, and communicate clearly with the user through a conversational interface.

The long-term product direction is an embodied, autonomous assistant where the user can:
- Observe real-time market intelligence.
- Set explicit trading rules.
- Delegate approved autonomy under risk guardrails.
- Override instantly with kill-switch controls.

## Product goals
- Make forex automation accessible through a single control plane.
- Improve trading discipline via non-negotiable risk limits.
- Increase transparency with explainable actions and audit history.
- Keep user trust high with secure credential handling and explicit authorization.

## Main user experiences
- Embodied dashboard with live market context and bot state.
- Chat + command workflow for instructions such as:
  - "Sell USD/PKR at a target level."
  - "Enable autonomy with 1% risk per trade."
  - "Stop trading now."
- User/Admin dashboard for:
  - Profile and account details.
  - Broker account linkage.
  - Contact channels (email, mobile, WhatsApp).
  - Security posture and masked sensitive data handling.
  - Subscription readiness controls.

## Functional scope
- Real-time forex rates, sentiment, and news ingestion.
- Autonomous trade intent flow with explain-before-execute and risk checks.
- Paper/live mode control pathways.
- Multi-channel notification dispatch.
- Credential vault and subscription feature gating for controlled monetization.

## Intended rollout model
1. Free-access onboarding with safe defaults.
2. Paper-trading probation and user education.
3. Restricted live features with compliance and secure credential vault.
4. Optional paid plan gating for advanced autonomy and live execution features.
