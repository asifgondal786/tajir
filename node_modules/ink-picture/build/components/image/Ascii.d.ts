/**
 * ASCII Image Rendering Component
 *
 * Converts images to ASCII art using character-based representation.
 * This is the most compatible rendering method as it works in all terminals.
 *
 * Features:
 * - Works in all terminal environments (fallback protocol)
 * - Supports both monochrome and colored ASCII art
 * - Automatic color detection based on terminal capabilities
 *
 * Technical Details:
 * - Uses the 'ascii-art' library for image-to-ASCII conversion
 * - Applies image preprocessing (sharpening, normalization) for better results
 * - Color support is automatically detected and applied when available
 * - Temporary files are created and cleaned up during conversion
 *
 * @param props - Image rendering properties
 * @returns JSX element containing ASCII art representation of the image
