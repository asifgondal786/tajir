/**
 * Braille Image Rendering Component
 *
 * Renders images using Unicode Braille patterns to create high-resolution monochrome representations.
 * Each Braille character can represent 8 pixels (2x4 grid), providing higher resolution than
 * other text-based rendering methods.
 *
 * Features:
 * - High resolution monochrome rendering (8 pixels per character)
 * - Uses Unicode Braille patterns (U+2800-U+28FF)
 * - Requires only Unicode support (no color needed)
 * - Good for detailed images and line art
 * - Works well for images with clear contrast
 *
 * Technical Details:
 * - Each Braille character represents a 2x4 pixel grid
 * - Uses luminance-based threshold for black/white conversion
 * - Handles transparency by treating transparent pixels as white
 * - Braille patterns are constructed using bit manipulation
 *
 * Braille Pattern Layout:
 * ```
 * 1 4
 * 2 5
 * 3 6
 * 7 8
 * ```
 *
 * @param props - Image rendering properties
 * @returns JSX element containing Braille pattern representation of the image
