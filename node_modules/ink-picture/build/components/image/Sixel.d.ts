/**
 * Sixel Image Rendering Component
 *
 * Displays images using the Sixel graphics protocol, providing the highest quality
 * image rendering in supported terminals. Sixel is a bitmap graphics format that
 * can display true color images at full resolution.
 *
 * Features:
 * - Highest quality image rendering (true color, full resolution)
 * - Supports all image formats
 * - Requires specific terminal support (VT340+, xterm, iTerm2, etc.)
 * - Direct pixel-to-pixel rendering
 *
 * Technical Details:
 * - Uses the Sixel graphics protocol
 * - Renders directly to terminal using escape sequences
 * - Bypasses Ink's normal rendering pipeline for control over image position
 * - Requires careful cursor management and cleanup
 *
 * **EXPERIMENTAL COMPONENT WARNING:**
 * This component does not follow React/Ink's normal rendering lifecycle.
 * It implements custom rendering logic that writes directly to the terminal.
 * While designed to be as React-compatible as possible, you may experience:
 * - Rendering flicker
 * - Cursor positioning issues
 * - Cleanup problems on component unmount
 *
 * How it works:
 * 1. A Box component reserves space in the layout
 * 2. Image is fetched and converted to Sixel format
 * 3. useEffect hook renders image directly to terminal after each Ink render
 * 4. Previous image is cleared before rendering new content
 * 5. Cleanup occurs on component unmount or re-render
 * 6. Cleanup will not be performed when application terminates (so the rendered image is preserved in its location)
 *
 * @param props - Image rendering properties
 * @returns JSX element that manages Sixel image display
