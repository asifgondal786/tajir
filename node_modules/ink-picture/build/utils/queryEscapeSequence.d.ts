/**
 * Send a message to stdout and wait for a response from stdin.
 * Meant for getting replies from control sequences
 * This should NOT be used for getting user input.
 *
 * @param message The message to send to stdout.
 * @param stdin The stdin stream to read the response from, this should be from Ink's useStdin.
 * @param stdout The stdout stream to send the message to, this should be from Ink's useStdout.
 * @returns A promise that resolves with the response string, or undefined if no response is received within the timeout.
 *
 * @note Ink's own stdin/stdout handles Ctrl+C and other signals while enabling raw mode used by useInput, if you use process.stdin/process.stdout you will break one of those
